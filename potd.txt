What is the output of the following Java code?

public class Test {

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int x = 10;
        System.out.print(x + " ");
    }

    static {
        int x = 20;
        System.out.print(x + " ");
    } 
Output 20 10
Solution description
static block is executed before main() method. If we declare a static block in the java class it is executed when the class is loaded.
What is the output of the following Java code?

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        int a = 6;

        System.out.println(" ~a = " + ~a);
    }
}Explanation
In two's complement representation (which Java uses for integers), the bitwise NOT of a number n is equal to -(n + 1).

For a = 6:

~6 computes to -(6 + 1), which is -7.
